Problem Statement:
Designing a BMI calculator using GUI Tkinter in Python. Body mass index (BMI) is a useful measure of
underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese condition. BMI Calculator is a simple calculator
using advanced features.
Keywords:
BMI: Body Mass Index is a value derived from the mass and height of a person. The BMI is defined as
the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting
from mass in kilograms and height in meters.
Abstract :
The project is called BMI calculator. It is built using Tkinter for GUI and python at the backend. When
the program is executed, a window appears in which the user has to enter his/ her weight and height
by sliding through the bar. Then a message is displayed, showing the user whether he/ she is obese,
underweight or in the normal range. If the condition is extreme, it prompts the user to consult a
doctor.
